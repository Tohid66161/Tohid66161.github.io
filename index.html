          In multi-robot systems (MRS), cooperative localization is a crucial task for enhancing system robustness and scalability, especially in GPS-denied or communication-limited environments. However, adversarial attacks, such as sensor manipulation, and communication jamming, pose significant challenges to the performance of traditional localization methods. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed fault-tolerant cooperative localization framework to enhance resilience against sensor and communication disruptions in adversarial environments. We introduce an adaptive event-triggered communication strategy that dynamically adjusts communication thresholds based on real-time sensing and communication quality. This strategy ensures optimal performance even in the presence of sensor degradation or communication failure. Furthermore, we conduct a rigorous analysis of the convergence and stability properties of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its resilience against bounded adversarial zones and maintaining accurate state estimation. Robotarium-based experiment results show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of localization accuracy and communication efficiency, particularly in adversarial settings. Our approach offers improved scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance for MRS, making it suitable for large-scale deployments in real-world, challenging environments.

          This paper presents a distributed multi-target coverage control framework for multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems that integrates Voronoi-based coverage control with altitude optimization. The proposed method enables robots to adjust their positions and altitudes dynamically to optimize sensing performance across varying target distributions. The framework effectively balances trade-offs between detection costs and coverage area by determining the optimal position and altitude for each robot. This allows the system to adapt to different environmental conditions and target densities, ensuring optimal performance in various scenarios. In the proposed framework, robots descend to lower altitudes in high-density target regions to improve detection accuracy, while in sparse regions, they ascend to maximize coverage. A minimum altitude constraint is obtained to maintain precise tracking in dense areas, ensuring that robots do not operate at excessively low altitudes. The approach guarantees complete coverage of the target space by guiding robots toward the weighted centroids of their respective Voronoi cells, thereby ensuring efficient task allocation and spatial distribution. Simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving tracking accuracy and coverage efficiency in different environments. The results validate the capability of the framework to handle real-time, multi-target tracking and sensor coverage in complex target distributions.

          This article addresses a new cooperative localization problem for a team of mobile robots subject to limited communication resources. First, we develop a decentralized event-triggered cooperative localization (DECL) algorithm for multirobot system such that each robot localizes itself with minimum communication exchange between robots. Then, using an event-triggered mechanism we propose an optimization framework to achieve a balance between estimation performance and communication rate. Simulation results show the main benefits of the event-triggered mechanism. Also, experimental results using four e-puck2 mobile robots demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Note to Practitioners—Multiple mobile robots are able to implement certain tasks that are beyond the capabilities of individual robots. In multirobot system, the accurate localization of each robot in the team is essential for a successful operation. Existing cooperative localization approaches neglect some realistic limitations of mobile robots, such as battery capacity and communication bandwidth. Especially, this issue is important when the number of sensors, actuators, and robots in the team increases. This article was motivated by these realistic limitations of mobile robots and it suggests a new approach for cooperative localization based on event-triggered mechanism. Motived by the aforementioned discussion, our objective is to design and implement the event-triggered cooperative localization for a group of e-puck2 robots. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results show that we achieve a tradeoff between localization accuracy and communication resources.

          In multirobot systems, the accurate localization of each mobile robot in the team is a prerequisite to reach consensus. This article investigates the problem of event-triggered consensus control for a group of mobile robots based on cooperative localization (CL). In our framework, each robot employs the position estimates from CL to jointly achieve consensus. An event-triggered mechanism based on a mixed-type condition is adopted in order to reduce the frequency of control updates and unnecessary transmission of information between system components. Our goal is to design an event-triggered consensus controller based on CL such that the closed-loop system achieves the prescribed consensus in spite of inaccurate sensor measurements. We provide sufficient conditions that guarantee the desired consensus using eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix. We design the controller and filter gains as well as the parameters of the event-triggering mechanism simultaneously in terms of the solution for a linear matrix inequality. Finally, simulation and experimental results are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approach.

Cooperative multi-robot systems (MRS) are a
promising solution for various applications such as autonomous
driving, search and rescue, and warehouse logistics. A crucial
challenge for these systems is cooperative localization, where
multiple robots estimate their relative positions to enhance
accuracy in GPS/localization-denied environments. Traditional
methods, such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and
Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), struggle with nonlinear motion
models, sensor noise, and computational inefficiencies,
often leading to filter divergence in dynamic scenarios. These
challenges are further exacerbated in large-scale MRS, where
maintaining reliable communication becomes increasingly difficult
due to dynamic network topologies, constrained bandwidth,
and the high computational and communication demands of
processing dense inter-robot measurements in real-time. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces a distributed
adaptive event-based Cubature Kalman Filter (DEB-CKF) that
integrates an event-triggered mechanism with a novel CKF
to enhance cooperative localization accuracy while optimizing
communication and computation efficiency. Specifically, an
adaptive event filter dynamically adjusts data transmission
based on network topology and position estimates. We theoretically
and experimentally analyze the convergence and stability
of the proposed algorithm and validate it against EKF and
UKF methods in a leader-follower scenario. Experimental results
demonstrate that DEB-CKF achieves superior localization
accuracy and communication efficiency, particularly in highdensity
networks with dynamic maneuvers.        </p>

This paper introduces a decentralized control
framework for safe and adaptive multi-robot formation in
dynamic and uncertain environments. The proposed approach
formulates a generalized quadratic program (QP) that integrates
multiple Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for safety,
connectivity preservation, and obstacle avoidance with a Control
Lyapunov Function (CLF) for goal convergence. To resolve
inherent conflicts among these objectives, we present
the first integration of behavior trees with CBF–CLF–QP
control, providing a structured and modular mechanism for
prioritized switching across safety, connectivity, formation, and
goal-reaching tasks without deadlock. The proposed framework
is fully decentralized, computationally efficient, and scalable,
with each agent solving a local QP in sub-millisecond cycles,
making it practical for real-time, on-board implementation.
Extensive simulations and experiments in cluttered, dynamic
environments with moving obstacles and uncertain obstacle
geometries demonstrate the method’s ability to ensure safety,
maintain network connectivity, and achieve resilient formation
control while adapting to rapidly changing conditions.       </p>

This paper presents a hybrid approach to multitarget
search in unknown environments using multi-robot
systems, designed to adapt to varying communication conditions
and adversary levels. The proposed method addresses key challenges,
including limited sensing range and inaccurate decisionmaking
due to communication disruptions. To support adaptive
decision-making, a grid-based environmental map is employed,
integrating information on obstacles, coverage, target occupancy,
and communication quality. To overcome communication
constraints, we develop an adaptive communication-aware,
learning-based distributed model predictive control framework.
Under robust communication, the framework leverages shared
map data to generate the trajectory of robots. When communication
degrades, it autonomously generates reliable predictions
based on prior inter-robot interactions, reducing dependence
on real-time data exchange. Additionally, a probabilistic model
incorporating layered circular danger zones with a radially
symmetric Gaussian-like distribution is introduced to assess and
mitigate the impact of varying adversary levels on communication
quality. The approach dynamically balances cooperative
search with learning-based local search based on the severity
of the adversarial zone. Extensive comparative experiments
conducted on diverse maps demonstrate that the proposed
framework significantly reduces communication overhead and
search time while enhancing prediction accuracy and overall
system resilience against different adversary levels.      </p>

Autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), particularly
quadrotors, have shown significant potential in assisting
humans with tasks such as construction and package
delivery. These applications benefit greatly from the use of
cables for manipulation mechanisms due to their lightweight,
low-cost, and simple design. However, designing effective control
and planning strategies for cable-suspended systems presents
several challenges, including indirect load actuation, nonlinear
configuration space, and highly coupled system dynamics. In
this paper, we introduce a novel event-triggered distributed
Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) method specifically
designed for cooperative transportation involving multiple
quadrotors manipulating a cable-suspended payload. This
approach addresses key challenges such as payload manipulation,
inter-robot separation, obstacle avoidance, and trajectory
tracking, all while optimizing the use of computational and
communication resources. By integrating an event-triggered
mechanism, our NMPC method reduces unnecessary computations
and communication, enhancing energy efficiency and
extending the operational range of MAVs. The proposed method
employs a lightweight state vector parametrization that focuses
on payload states in all six degrees of freedom, enabling
efficient planning of trajectories on the SE(3) manifold. This
not only reduces planning complexity but also ensures real-time
computational feasibility. Our approach is validated through
extensive simulation, demonstrating its efficacy in dynamic and
resource-constrained environments.      </p>

Multi-robot systems operating in dynamic and adversarial
environments face challenges such as communication
disruptions, sensor failures, and cyberattacks, compromising
navigation, safety, and coordination. This paper proposes a decentralized
resilience framework that integrates Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to enable
adaptive and safe navigation under adversarial conditions.
First, we introduce a probabilistic adversary model based on
a radially symmetric Gaussian-like distribution. This model
allows each robot to estimate adversarial region parameters
via likelihood maximization and refine these estimates through
collaborative consensus with neighboring agents. Second, we develop
an RL-based control framework augmented with a CBFbased
safety mechanism to ensure real-time policy adaptation
while enforcing safety constraints. During exploration, robots
actively navigate adversarial regions to learn their characteristics.
In the exploitation phase, they leverage the learned policy
to achieve task objectives while maintaining safety guarantees.
Multi-robot experiments validate the proposed framework’s
ability to ensure system stability, enforce safety constraints, and
dynamically adapt trajectories in GPS-denied and adversarial
environments. The results demonstrate superior performance
over state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing the effectiveness
of integrating probabilistic adversary modeling, decentralized
situational awareness, and adaptive safety-aware control, ultimately
paving the way for key advances in realizing resilient
multi-robot navigation in uncertain environments.      </p>

We study the problem of secure decentralized event-triggered cooperative localization
(SDECL) for a team of mobile robots in an adversarial environment, where the objective is to perform
localization in the presence of a malicious attacker. We consider a scenario in which an intruder is able
to attack the communication channels between exteroceptive sensors and filter of the robot and between
two robots independently. First, we design a secure decentralized event-triggered cooperative localization
in the multi-robot system against random Denial of Service (DoS) and False Data Injection (FDI) attacks.
Then, we provide sufficient conditions that ensure the resilience and convergence of the proposed algorithm
when the attacker signal rate is bounded. Simulation results show that by properly tuning the parameters
of the event-triggered mechanism and considering bounded attack rate, the proposed algorithm is resilient
against cyber attacks. Also, experimental results using four e-puck2 mobile robots have demonstrated the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

Energy management algorithms play a critical
role in improving the energy efficiency of modern electric
vehicles. In order to be desirable for the customer, electric
vehicles should be capable of long distance driving on a single
battery charge with a range which must be comparable to the
values of their conventional counterparts. To achieve this goal,
both the use of large-capacity battery and the development of a
custom energy management algorithm are necessary. Thus,
one must solve equations of vehicle dynamics, which is a part
of conventional methods used in generalized energy
management problems. In this paper, a Monte Carlo method is
proposed for probabilistic prediction of the optimum energy to
attain a given route. The route in question is obtained from the
Google Maps and includes locations and road topologies. First,
optimum speed set-points are generated for each state of the
journey, and this generated speed array is imported into the
vehicle control system to generate the required torque for
vehicle propulsion. Then, this process is repeated with a
constant average speed for comparison purposes. The
simulation results show that an electric vehicle gains significant
energy efficiency over a Hardware in the Loop (HIL)
emulation, when it is being controlled with the proposed speed
set-points generated by the Monte Carlo method.    </div>

This paper investigates an observer-based secure control problem for platooning of connected

collision. To deal with DoS attacks, we consider an observer-based mechanism to estimate the state of
vehicles based on available sensor measurements which significantly improves the resilience and tolerance of
platooning system during the attack interval. Then, we provide the optimization framework to maximize the
duration of the DoS attack such that the platooning system can tolerate safe operation without performance
degradation. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.  </div>

In this article, we investigate the secure consensus control problem for multirobot systems with eventtriggered communication strategy under aperiodic energylimited denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, where DoS attacks
prevent the transmission of information between robots.
Each robot is equipped with onboard sensors to estimate
its position cooperatively by taking relative measurements
and exchanging the local positioning information with other
robots through the unreliable communication network. In
the meantime, each robot determines its consensus control
based on transmitted position estimates and steers the
robot to the desired consensus position. Therefore, our
goal is to design a secure control scheme for each robot
based on cooperative localization with an event-triggered
mechanism and obtain a sufficient condition for the upper
bound of duration and the maximum number of attacks
such that N robots can move to the desired secure consensus position in the presence of DoS attacks. Finally,
simulation and experimental results are presented to show
the effectiveness of obtained theoretical results.

This paper presents a novel approach to range-based
distributed cooperative localization (DCL) for robot
swarms in GPS-denied environments, relying solely on interrobot
range measurements, specifically addressing the limitations
of current methods in noisy and sparse settings where
the geometric non-rigidity of the sensing graph creates flipping
(suboptimal) effects in the localization outcomes. We propose
a robust multilayered localization framework (DCL-Sparse)
that utilizes distributed 1-hop shadow edges (S1-Edge) to
address the non-rigidity problem and improve localization
convergence in sparse and noisy sensing graphs. Our approach
leverages the advantages of distributed localization methods,
enhancing scalability and adaptability in large robot networks.
We establish theoretical conditions for the new S1-Edge that
ensure solutions exist even in the presence of noise, thereby
validating the effectiveness of the new shadow edge localization.
Extensive simulation and real-world experiments confirm the
superior performance of our method compared to state-of-theart
techniques, resulting in a reduction of up to 93% in the
localization error in DCL. These experiments demonstrate substantial
improvements in localization accuracy and robustness
to sparse graphs. DCL-Sparse increases the localizability of
large multi-robot and sensor networks, offering a powerful
tool for high-performance and reliable operations in challenging
large-scale environments.

          In Search and Rescue missions, robots must operate in cluttered environments with limited sensing and communication. The challenge is to efficiently explore unknown areas while minimizing redundant coverage, ensure reliable and low-latency victim detection, and maintain safe, collision-free navigation with smooth recovery when stuck.           Our goal is to design a robust, plug-and-play system that runs in Webots using standard differential-drive robots, enabling scalable deployment in realistic search-and-rescue scenarios. The approach combines cooperative exploration, consensus-based rendezvous, and robust safety control. Each robot maintains a grid map, sharing with teammates to coordinate coverage. Victim detection has the highest priority—robots navigate to the detected victim’s world position or visually track it until depth data is available. Safety mechanisms include short-range braking, mid-field CBF with LiDAR, and stuck detection for autonomous recovery.

    <h3>Enhancing Cooperative Perception for Connected and Automated Vehicles with Event-Based Vision for Critical Scenario Detection</h3>

    <div style="color:#333; font-size:0.72rem; line-height:1.45;">
      Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to significantly improve road safety by 
      enhancing vehicle perception and decision-making. Current perception systems face challenges in critical 
      scenarios requiring high-speed detection and rapid response, such as sudden pedestrian appearances, 
      emergency vehicle maneuvers, and complex work-zone navigation. Traditional sensors like LiDAR and RGB 
      cameras struggle in high-speed, low-light, or occluded conditions, which can delay detection and hinder 
      timely reaction.
      To address these limitations, this project integrates event-based vision  with multi-sensor data 
      fusion from both vehicle-mounted and infrastructure sensors. Event cameras, with their high temporal 
      resolution and asynchronous data acquisition, enable real-time detection and tracking of fast-moving 
      objects. By fusing event-based data with LiDAR, radar, and depth camera information, this framework 
      facilitates predictive perception and low-latency response, ensuring robust detection of critical 
      events for safer and more efficient autonomous driving.

      In recent years, there is a surge in research on Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs),
as PEVs are one of the ways that we can reduce carbon emissions. Dramatic cost
reduction in PEVs has resulted in their becoming mainstream vehicles. However,
there is still one big hurdle before they can take over other types of vehicles, and that
is their limited range. Lack of charging stations exacerbates the situation further, and
proliferation of charging stations does not completely alleviate the range problem as
charging can take a few hours. Therefore, a PEV should cover as much distance with
a given battery charge, or equivalently, should consume as little energy as possible
for a given distance. The choice of the instantaneous control algorithm plays a role
in this energy minimization problem, but on the other hand, the most critical aspect
of this minimization problem is the speed profile of the vehicle, which is given as a
reference input to the instantaneous control algorithm. This thesis offers a significant
contribution to the literature in range optimization of PEVs given a realistic vehicle
model, which it does through a combination of Monte Carlo and Newton-Raphson
optimization methods.

    <h3>Design and Analysis of a Robust Control System for Triple Inverted Pendulum

      The design of robust controllers for triple inverted pendulum systems presents significant challenges due to their inherent instability and nonlinear dynamics. Moreover, uncertainties in system parameters further complicate the control design. This paper investigates a robust control strategy for triple inverted pendulums under parameter uncertainty. Two control approaches, namely the H∞ controller and the µ-synthesis controller, are compared in terms of their ability to achieve reference tracking and disturbance rejection. Simulation results demonstrate that the H∞ controller provides superior transient performance, making it a promising solution for robust stabilization of such complex systems.

    <h3>Optimal Charging Station Allocation and Path
Planning for Multi-Robot Electric Fleets</h3>

    <div style="color:#333; font-size:0.72rem; line-height:1.45;">
      This project explored mathematical optimization techniques to design efficient charging station allocation and route planning for a group of electric autonomous robots (e.g., delivery robots).
The key goal was to minimize total energy consumption while ensuring all robots can complete assigned tasks without running out of battery.
