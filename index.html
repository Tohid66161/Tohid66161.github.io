          In multi-robot systems (MRS), cooperative localization is a crucial task for enhancing system robustness and scalability, especially in GPS-denied or communication-limited environments. However, adversarial attacks, such as sensor manipulation, and communication jamming, pose significant challenges to the performance of traditional localization methods. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed fault-tolerant cooperative localization framework to enhance resilience against sensor and communication disruptions in adversarial environments. We introduce an adaptive event-triggered communication strategy that dynamically adjusts communication thresholds based on real-time sensing and communication quality. This strategy ensures optimal performance even in the presence of sensor degradation or communication failure. Furthermore, we conduct a rigorous analysis of the convergence and stability properties of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its resilience against bounded adversarial zones and maintaining accurate state estimation. Robotarium-based experiment results show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of localization accuracy and communication efficiency, particularly in adversarial settings. Our approach offers improved scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance for MRS, making it suitable for large-scale deployments in real-world, challenging environments.

          This paper presents a distributed multi-target coverage control framework for multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems that integrates Voronoi-based coverage control with altitude optimization. The proposed method enables robots to adjust their positions and altitudes dynamically to optimize sensing performance across varying target distributions. The framework effectively balances trade-offs between detection costs and coverage area by determining the optimal position and altitude for each robot. This allows the system to adapt to different environmental conditions and target densities, ensuring optimal performance in various scenarios. In the proposed framework, robots descend to lower altitudes in high-density target regions to improve detection accuracy, while in sparse regions, they ascend to maximize coverage. A minimum altitude constraint is obtained to maintain precise tracking in dense areas, ensuring that robots do not operate at excessively low altitudes. The approach guarantees complete coverage of the target space by guiding robots toward the weighted centroids of their respective Voronoi cells, thereby ensuring efficient task allocation and spatial distribution. Simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving tracking accuracy and coverage efficiency in different environments. The results validate the capability of the framework to handle real-time, multi-target tracking and sensor coverage in complex target distributions.

          This article addresses a new cooperative localization problem for a team of mobile robots subject to limited communication resources. First, we develop a decentralized event-triggered cooperative localization (DECL) algorithm for multirobot system such that each robot localizes itself with minimum communication exchange between robots. Then, using an event-triggered mechanism we propose an optimization framework to achieve a balance between estimation performance and communication rate. Simulation results show the main benefits of the event-triggered mechanism. Also, experimental results using four e-puck2 mobile robots demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Note to Practitioners—Multiple mobile robots are able to implement certain tasks that are beyond the capabilities of individual robots. In multirobot system, the accurate localization of each robot in the team is essential for a successful operation. Existing cooperative localization approaches neglect some realistic limitations of mobile robots, such as battery capacity and communication bandwidth. Especially, this issue is important when the number of sensors, actuators, and robots in the team increases. This article was motivated by these realistic limitations of mobile robots and it suggests a new approach for cooperative localization based on event-triggered mechanism. Motived by the aforementioned discussion, our objective is to design and implement the event-triggered cooperative localization for a group of e-puck2 robots. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results show that we achieve a tradeoff between localization accuracy and communication resources.

          In multirobot systems, the accurate localization of each mobile robot in the team is a prerequisite to reach consensus. This article investigates the problem of event-triggered consensus control for a group of mobile robots based on cooperative localization (CL). In our framework, each robot employs the position estimates from CL to jointly achieve consensus. An event-triggered mechanism based on a mixed-type condition is adopted in order to reduce the frequency of control updates and unnecessary transmission of information between system components. Our goal is to design an event-triggered consensus controller based on CL such that the closed-loop system achieves the prescribed consensus in spite of inaccurate sensor measurements. We provide sufficient conditions that guarantee the desired consensus using eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix. We design the controller and filter gains as well as the parameters of the event-triggering mechanism simultaneously in terms of the solution for a linear matrix inequality. Finally, simulation and experimental results are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approach.
