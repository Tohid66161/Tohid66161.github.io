      <h1>Tohid Kargar Tasooji</h1>
      <p>
        I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the 
        <a href="https://hero.uga.edu/" target="_blank">Heterogeneous Robotics (HeRo) Research Lab</a>, 
        working with Prof. Ramviyas Parasuraman at the 
        <a href="https://www.uga.edu/" target="_blank">University of Georgia</a>. I am developing advanced algorithms for multi-robot systems, focusing on resilient cooperative localization, communication-aware coverage, and learning-enabled control strategies for autonomous navigation in dynamic and adversarial environments. My work integrates event-triggered control, model predictive frameworks, and hierarchical decision-making to enhance the robustness, safety, and efficiency of heterogeneous robotic teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        I received my PhD in Control and Robotic Engineering from the 
        <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/" target="_blank">University of Alberta</a> in 2023. During my PhD, I led efforts in the Advanced Control Systems Lab, working on event-triggered cooperative control and localization for multi-robot systems, designing resilient and secure control schemes, and developing real-time algorithms for autonomous navigation and multi-agent coordination.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also worked at <a href="https://www.gm.com/" target="_blank">General Motors</a>, where I developed algorithms for vehicle dynamics, autonomous driving, and ADAS features, including route optimization, model-based control strategies, and simulation-based testing using MIL, SIL, and HIL environments.

          In multi-robot systems (MRS), cooperative localization is a crucial task for enhancing system robustness and scalability, especially in GPS-denied or communication-limited environments. However, adversarial attacks, such as sensor manipulation, and communication jamming, pose significant challenges to the performance of traditional localization methods. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed fault-tolerant cooperative localization framework to enhance resilience against sensor and communication disruptions in adversarial environments. We introduce an adaptive event-triggered communication strategy that dynamically adjusts communication thresholds based on real-time sensing and communication quality. This strategy ensures optimal performance even in the presence of sensor degradation or communication failure. Furthermore, we conduct a rigorous analysis of the convergence and stability properties of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its resilience against bounded adversarial zones and maintaining accurate state estimation. Robotarium-based experiment results show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of localization accuracy and communication efficiency, particularly in adversarial settings. Our approach offers improved scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance for MRS, making it suitable for large-scale deployments in real-world, challenging environments.
